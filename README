Tools for Power Management Lab at KIT
=====================================

Current status of the repository: STABLE, works good :-) 

Developed for the PowerManagement Lab at the KIT (Karlsruhe Institute of
Technology [1]). More information about the PM Lab at [2]. Main repository at

https://github.com/weissi/pm-lab-tools


Functionality
-------------

Reads data from a connected measuring device (currently only NI USB-6218 [3]
implemented) and sends the data to connected clients via TCP/IP. The wire format
is implemented using Google Protocol Buffers [4].

The tool set is divided into two parts: The server (called daemon) and the
client (made of a very simple library libpmlab and a binary using the library
called pmlabclient).


Compatibility
-------------
Client and Server have been tested using Linux and Mac OS X 10.6 (a.k.a. Lion).


Building
--------
To build the whole tool set just type

./build.sh

if necessary, it will download and build the dependencies (protobuf, protobuf-c
and pbl) without touching your system. It will link the daemon binary against
NI-DAQmx Base [5] to be able to interface the NI USB-6218 and therefore expects
CFLAGS and LDFLAGS to be set appropriately. To build without NI-DAQmx Base, type

./build.sh -n

Using the `-n' option, repeating, realistic test data will be sent to the
clients.


Usage
-----
Server:
  build/daemon

Client:
  build/pmlabclient SERVER PORT CHANNEL...

  SERVER is the host where daemon is running
  PORT is usually 12345
  CHANNEL is AI0, AI1, ..., AI8 for the differential analog inputs
